# Revenue Skills Library

**29 AI skills for Shopify sales teams**, mapped across the full merchant journey — from prospecting to expansion.

Built from how our highest performers work, aligned to the merchant journey, and grounded in leading practices and live data.

## Quick Start

Install any skill:
```bash
cp -r skills/<skill-name> ~/.pi/agent/skills/    # Pi
cp -r skills/<skill-name> ~/.claude/skills/       # Claude Code
```

## What's a Skill?

A skill is a reusable AI instruction set. When an AE needs to prep for a call, prioritize their pipeline, or write a follow-up, a skill does the research in parallel, pulls the right data from Salesforce and BigQuery, and delivers the output in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.

## Journey Coverage (29 skills)

| **Solution** | product-agentic, product-headless-hydrogen, agentic-plan-sell | 3 |

Cross-cutting              → competitive-positioning, product-*, signal-monitor, outbound-cadence
```

## Quality System

Every skill is scored 0-100 by an LLM judge against a 7-dimension rubric:

1. Problem Definition & Scope (0-15)
2. Tool & Data Source Specification (0-10)
3. Investigation Workflow (0-20)
4. SQL & Data Queries (0-15)
5. Output Format (0-15)
6. Error Handling (0-10)
7. Anti-Gaming Quality Signals (0-15)

**Current average: 72/100** | 7 skills at 78 (top tier) | Target: 78+ for all

Run the grader: `bash autoresearch.sh <skill-name>` (~$0.05/skill via Shopify AI proxy)
